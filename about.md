Solutions Architect, with 8+ years of industry experience in designing large-scale distributed systems, legacy-system modernization, and performance optimization of under-performing systems. Iâ€™ve gained experience specifically in middleware, including layer 7 load balancers, application servers, messaging systems from MQs to Kafka, microservices and Oracle DBMS. With my extensive experience in programming, I have been contributing to open-source Java projects such as Spring Cloud and Spring Boot, and I have developed proprietary front-end component frameworks and state machine libraries in JavaScript.
